if the JDK is not available, or the version is lower than 7, down load it here:

https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

2. Download Android Studio. Go to

This page will automatically detect your operating system. Accept the terms and conditions to start the download. Double-click the downloaded file and follow all the prompts. After finishing the install, the Setup Wizard will download and install some additional components. Be patient, this might take some time depending on your internet speed.
 
3. At the start up of Android Studio, click Check Out project from Version Control, pick GIT and paste GitHub URL for the project https://github.com/forfireonly/SignLanguage .

4.Connect your phone to your computer with a USB cable. If you're using Windows, you might need to install the appropriate USB driver for your device.

5.Enable USB debugging in the Developer options as follows. First, you must enable the developer options:
Open the Settings app.
